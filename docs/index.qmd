## About Me

I am **Emre Ozbalta**, based in **New York City**. I work as a **Data Analyst** on the **Mobile Wallet Fraud Analytics team at Bank of America**.

This is my first semester in the **Quantitative Methods & Modeling master’s program at Baruch College**.

Originally from **Istanbul, Turkey**, I have been living in NYC for more than eight years.

I have a lifelong passion for **soccer**—I’ve played since I was six years old and even competed semi-professionally in Turkey. I also love **traveling** and I’m a **big foodie with a sweet tooth**—I’ll happily travel just for food.

Above all, I’m obsessed with **statistics and facts**, and I’m always trying to reach the truth through numbers.
